# How to login
login.js doesn't work sucks for me but you can get a cookie manually

# How to get cookie
1. Use the Cookie Extractor extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/j2team-cookies/okpidcojinmlaakglciglbpcpajaibco/related) to get a text of the cookies.
2. Create an auth.json file in the auth folder and paste the value of the "cookies" entry in the aforementioned txt.
3. Replace all occurrences of "name" in the json file with "key".
